# Tools Glossary

This document provides detailed definitions for all tools referenced in the [Tool Availability Matrix](README.md#tool-availability-matrix).

**Note:** Definitions come from the MCP servers.

## Built-In (VS Code / Core)

### Code & Project Navigation

#### codebase
Search, read, and analyze project source code.

#### findTestFiles
Given a source (or test) file, locate its corresponding test (or source) counterpart.

#### search
Search and read files in the workspace.

#### searchResults
Access the current search view results programmatically.

#### usages
Find references, definitions, implementations, and other symbol usages.

### Quality & Diagnostics

#### problems
Retrieve diagnostics (errors/warnings) for a file.

#### testFailure
Surface details about the most recent unit test failure.

### Version Control & Changes

#### changes
Get diffs of locally changed files.

### Environment & Execution

#### terminalLastCommand
Return the last executed command in the active terminal.

#### terminalSelection
Return the currently selected text in the terminal (Code mode only).

#### think
Use this tool to think deeply about the user's request and organize your thoughts. This tool helps improve response quality by allowing the model to consider the request carefully, brainstorm solutions, and plan complex tasks. It's particularly useful for:

1. Exploring repository issues and brainstorming bug fixes
2. Analyzing test results and planning fixes
3. Planning complex refactoring approaches
4. Designing new features and architecture
5. Organizing debugging hypotheses

The tool logs a summarized thought process for transparency but doesn't execute any code or make changes.

#### todos
Scan the workspace (or specified files) for TODO / FIXME / NOTE style comments and aggregate them into a structured list (file, line, tag, description). Useful for backlog grooming, debt triage, and planning follow-up tasks. Read-only and non-mutating.

### Web & External Content

#### fetch
Fetch main textual content from a web page (provide URL and optional query focus).

#### githubRepo
Search a public GitHub repository for relevant code snippets.

### Editor & Extensions

#### extensions
Discover or inspect installed/available editor extensions.

#### vscodeAPI

### Editing & Automation

#### editFiles

#### runCommands

#### runTasks
Create/run tasks (build/test/etc.) via tasks configuration (Code mode only).

## GitHub Pull Requests Extension (VS Code)

#### activePullRequest
Retrieve context for the currently focused pull request.

#### copilotCodingAgent
Completes the provided task using an asynchronous coding agent. Use when the user wants copilot to continue completing a task in the background or asynchronously. Launch an autonomous GitHub Copilot agent to work on coding tasks in the background. The agent will create a new branch, implement the requested changes, and open a pull request with the completed work.

## Context7
